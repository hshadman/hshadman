# Hello, I'm Hossain Shadman.

Iâ€™m a computational researcher working at the intersection of **biochemistry**, **computational biology**, **bioinformatics**, and **machine learning**.  

Much of my past work has focused on the sequenceâ€“structureâ€“function relationships of **intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)**, though my interests also extend more broadly across **computational biology** and **bioinformatics**.

The selected publications below reflect some of my computational work. Iâ€™m eager to continue working in these areas and further expand my expertise.
